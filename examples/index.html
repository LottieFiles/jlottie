                        jlottie has been engineered to address the performance and bulkiness issues of existing Lottie players
                        for the web. jlottie also guarantees that no frames are dropped in a Lottie animation during playback, 
                        no matter how old the host hardware is.

                        jlottie's performance is achieved by compiling the Lottie source into a scene graph, which is subsequently used 
                        to play the animation. This forgoes any need to perform real-time computations during playback. The 
                        compilation process also optimizes the sequencing of all the transformations that make up a Lottie animation.

                        For animations of average complexity, jlottie consumes as little as half the CPU resources as the current Lottie 
                        web player. As complexity increases, this efficiency also increases.

                        At he most recent version of jlottie is over 80% smaller than 
                        the vanilla version of the current Lottie player for the web. This reduction is achieved primarily through the use of 
                        polymorphic functions applied across congruent data sets that are used for various purposes. Even when jlottie 
                        reaches 90+% of feature parity with the current Lottie web player, its size is expected to be less than half that
                        of its alternatives.

                        One of the problems with the current Lottie web player is that it skips frames when the host computer 
                        or device cannot meet the processing throughput. Animations playing on this player starts visibly tearing 
                        when 20 or more averagely complex Lottie animations are loaded simultaneously.

                        Conversely, jlottie never drops a frame during playback, no matter how many Lottie animations are loaded. 
                        This means that the CPU demand is proportionate to the number Lottie animations playing simultaneously. Even so, 
                        with 20 concurrent Lottie animations loaded on an average computer, jlottie manages to outperform the current web 
                        Lottie player whilst maintaining frame rates and avoiding jitter. This phenomenon can be tested by visiting the
