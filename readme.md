**jlottie** is a Lottie player written in javascript with an aim to have the smallest possible file size. jlottie is suitable as a general purpose lottie player, though implements a subset of the features in the core player - this approach leads to a tiny footprint and great performance.

jlottie's performance is achieved by compiling the Lottie source into a scene graph, which is subsequently used to play the animation. This forgoes any need to perform real-time computations during playback. jlottie is suitable for use when there are many animations playing on a single page.

At only 9kb when gzipped, jlottie is perfect as a lightweight addition to any webapp where not all of the lottie featues are necessary - common use cases include animated icons and micro animations. A list of all of the playback features is available [here](docs/features.html), and there's a test page available [here](https://lottiefiles.github.io/jlottie).

}
```

#### Returns

Type: `Null`

### `jlottie.pause(elementId)`

## Development

### Building

##### 1. Install dependencies.

```sh
yarn install
```

##### 2. Dev mode.

```sh
yarn dev
```

Automatically build and preview while developing. This runs `rollup` in watch mode and spins up a server at port 10000
to preview and test the builds.

##### 3. Production builds.

```sh
yarn build
```

This creates ESM, CJS and UMD builds in the `dist` directory.

### Testing

1. Install packages

```sh
yarn install
```

2. Run test command.

```sh
yarn test
```

This will generate snapshots in the `__snapshots__` directory and warn of mismatches with `lottie-web` renderer as the
comparison baseline.
