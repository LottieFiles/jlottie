                        jlottie has been engineered to address the performance and bulkiness issues of existing Lottie
                        players for the web. jlottie also guarantees that no frames are dropped in a Lottie animation
                        during playback, no matter how old the host hardware is.

                        jlottie's performance is achieved by compiling the Lottie source into a scene graph, which is
                        subsequently used to play the animation. This forgoes any need to perform real-time computations
                        during playback. The compilation process also optimizes the sequencing of all the
                        transformations that make up a Lottie animation.

                        For animations of average complexity, jlottie consumes as little as half the CPU resources as
                        the current Lottie web player. As complexity increases, this efficiency also increases.

                        jlottie and the current web Lottie player were stress tested using 35 simultaneously playing
                        animations, the features of which were fully supported by jlottie. The 
                        <b><a href='https://lottiefiles.github.io/jlottie/examples/general_jlottie2.html'>jlottie test</a></b>

                        consumption of 650MB. The same stress test performed using

                        The most recent version of jlottie is over 80% smaller than the vanilla version of the current
                        Lottie player for the web. This reduction is achieved primarily through the use of polymorphic
                        functions applied across congruent data sets that are used for various purposes. Even when
                        jlottie reaches 90+% of feature parity with the current Lottie web player, its size is expected
                        to be less than half that of its alternatives.

                        One of the problems with the current Lottie web player is that it skips frames when the host
                        computer or device cannot meet the processing throughput. Animations playing on this player
                        starts visibly tearing when 20 or more averagely complex Lottie animations are loaded
                        simultaneously.

                        Conversely, jlottie never drops a frame during playback, no matter how many Lottie animations
                        are loaded. This means that the CPU demand is proportionate to the number Lottie animations
                        playing simultaneously. Even so, with 20 concurrent Lottie animations loaded on an average
                        computer, jlottie manages to outperform the current web Lottie player whilst maintaining frame
                        rates and avoiding jitter. This phenomenon can be tested by visiting the following links:
